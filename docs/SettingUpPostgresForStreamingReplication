First thing first. To setup postgres instances in primary standby mode, you need at least two instances of postgres to play with. I am going to work with postgres version 9.3 and my host operating system in ubuntu.

h3. Creating postgres cluster instances

Assuming you have postgres installed. Here is a simple utility that can give you multiple instances of postgres in a minute. Here is what I ran.











bq. {color:blue}pg_createcluster 9.3 pgpool_cluster_standby \--start-conf manual{color}
bq. {color:blue}pg_createcluster 9.3 pgpool_cluster \--start-conf manual{color}
_not this command shall require either root( or sudo privilege). Alternatively you can login into postgres user to perform these actions.To see detailed controls that this utility provide, try pg_createcluster \--help_

The above command gives me two postgres instances on port 5433 and 5434.

To see the details about the postgres instances running on your machine, you can use below command











bq. {color:blue}pg_lscluster{color}
Here is the output I got
{quote}{color:grey}postgres@ubuntu:/etc/postgresql/9.3/pgpool_cluster$ pg_lsclusters{color}
{color:grey}Ver Cluster                Port Status Owner    Data directory                                 Log file{color}
{color:grey}9.3 main                   5432 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main                   /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.3-main.log{color}
{color:grey}9.3 pgpool_cluster         5433 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/pgpool_cluster         /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.3-pgpool_cluster.log{color}
{color:grey}9.3 pgpool_cluster_standby 5434 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/pgpool_cluster_standby /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.3-pgpool_cluster_standby.log{color}
{quote}

Note that configuration files for postgres are by default on this path on ubuntu {anchor:ConfigFilesPath}{{/etc/postgres/<version>/}}. In our case version is 9.3

h3. Configuring postgres instances to run in streaming replication mode

This is going to be a series of steps that I needed to perform. *First two actions are required to be performed on both the instances of postgres.*
[#AllowingConnectionsToPostgres]
[#ChangePassword]
[#ConfiguringFiles]
[#CreatingBaseBackupAndRestoringItToStandby]
[#SettingUpFailoverScript]

----
{anchor:AllowingConnectionsToPostgres} *Allowing Connections To Postgres*

You need to allow connections to your newly created instances. To understand what I mean by this, here is what I propose you to do. Try these out:

Login into postgres user from terminal
bq. {color:blue}sudo su - postgres{color}
_start pgpool_cluster instance_
bq. {color:blue}pg_ctlcluster 9.3 pgpool_cluster start{color}
\_now try
bq. {color:blue}psql{color}
{anchor:error1}You shall see error like this:
{quote}
{color:grey}psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory{color}
{color:grey}Is the server running locally and accepting{color}
{color:grey}connections on Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?{color}
{quote}

Now, once you have seen this, stopping the postgres instance that you just started. Use pg_ctlcluster utility for the same.

To get past this issue, make sure that pg_hba.conf file on this [#ConfigFilesPath] have connection mode set as trust. (Note: this only for setting up postgres in dev environment. For production environment, this file needs to be very much fine tuned)

Note: I am making change for replication privileges too here.

Here is what you need to edit. (note: I have uncommented last two lines)
{quote}
local   all             postgres {color:blue}trust{color}
\#TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
\#"local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all {color:blue}trust{color}
\#IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32 {color:blue}trust{color}
\#IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5
\#Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
\#replication privilege.
local   replication     postgres {color:blue}trust{color}
host    replication     postgres        127.0.0.1/32 {color:blue}trust{color}
\#host    replication     postgres        ::1/128                 md5

{quote}

You shall still see the [#error1] mentioned above if you still try to perform above steps. Hold on still. We need to change the password too.
----
{anchor:ChangePassword} *Changing the password*

To gain access to newly created instances you shall need to change the password for user postgres for newly created instances.Perform these steps. Note, if you are already logged in the terminal with postgres user, then you can skip through step 1 below.
{quote}
{color:blue}sudo su - postgres{color}
{color:blue}psql \-U postgres \-h localhost \-p 5433{color}
{color:blue}alter user postgres with password '<newpassword>';{color}
{quote}
----
{anchor:ConfiguringFiles} *Configuring files*

I am going to make pgpool_cluster (port 5433) as my primary and pgpool_cluster_standby (port 5434) as my hot standby server. With this in mind here are the changes I am going to do on this file {{/etc/postgresql/9.3/pgpool_cluster/postgresql.conf}} at path [#ConfigFilesPath]





{color:blue}bq. wal_level = hot_standby{color}
{color:blue}bq. checkpoint_segments = 10{color}
{color:blue}bq. checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9{color}
{color:blue}bq. max_wal_senders = 10{color}
{color:blue}bq. wal_keep_segments = 100{color}
{color:blue}bq. hot_standby = on{color}

Similarly file {{/etc/postgresql/9.3/pgpool_cluster_standby/postgresql.conf}} needs to be changed as above.

Once this is done, then on *{_}{+}data directory{+}{_}* we need to create a file with name *recovery.conf* with a content similar to this.
{quote}
\#If "recovery.conf" is present in the PostgreSQL data directory, it is
\#read on postmaster startup.  After successful recovery, it is renamed
\#to "recovery.done" to ensure that we do not accidentally re-enter
\#archive recovery or standby mode.
\#
standby_mode = 'on'
primary_conninfo = 'host=<master host ip> port=<master port> user=<recovery user> password=<password for recovery user>'
trigger_file = '<data directory>/trigger_file'
{quote}

*{_}+(NOTE IT: VERY IMPORTANT)+{_}* On master, name this file as recovery.done, while on standby name this file as recovery.conf. Also note, for recovery.done, conninfo shall be for standby; while for standby conninfo shall be of primary.

For example, this is the content of my recovery.done file that I am keeping in {{/var/lib/postgresql/9.3/pgpool_cluster}} path.
{quote}
standby_mode = 'on'
primary_conninfo = 'host=localhost port=5434 user=postgres password=zantaz'
trigger_file = '/var/lib/postgresql/9.3/pgpool_cluster/postgresql_pgpool_cluster.trigger'
{quote}

And this recovery.conf that I am keeping on this path {{}}
{quote}
standby_mode = 'on'
primary_conninfo = 'host=localhost port=5433 user=postgres password=zantaz'
trigger_file = '/var/lib/postgresql/9.3/pgpool_cluster/postgresql_pgpool_cluster_standby.trigger'
{quote}

----
{anchor:CreatingBaseBackupAndRestoringItToStandby} *Creating BaseBackup And Restoring It ToStandby*

This is what is desired.
bq. pg_ctlcluster 9.3 pgpool_cluster start;
bq. /usr/lib/postgresql/9.3/bin/pg_basebackup \-h localhost \-p 5433 \-U postgres \-D \~/primary.backup \-X stream
bq. cd /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/pgpool_cluster_standby
bq. cp ./recovery.conf \~/
bq. rm \-rf *
bq. cp \-R \~/primary.backup/\* .
bq. cp \~/recovery.conf .
bq. pg_ctlcluster 9.3 pgpool_cluster_standby start
Now your postgres servers are running. And one is primary and other is standby.

This is one good link that tells you how to restore standby from the basebackup of primary., follow this link [here|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-PITR-RECOVERY]
----
{anchor:SettingUpFailoverScript} *Setting Up Failover Script*

I haven't been able to do it. If you have any idea, please feel free to add that information here. (Some hint: some failover scripts have to be setup as part of this; Also I am not sure how to do the recovery in case of failover)

h2. Postgres Streaming Replication

Now few words on High Availability,Load Balancing, and Replication of
postgres.

There are two types of replication for postgres. Warm Standby (or log
shipping) and Stream Replication (hot standby)

Read about them here. [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/warm-standby.html]


Some notes for setting Postgres for Streaming Replication:
wal_keep_segments: on master are kept to some high value to ensure
that old WAL segments are not recycled soon

archive_timeout: not required

ALTERNATIVELY : If you set up a WAL archive that's accessible from the
standby, wal_keep_segments is not required as the standby can always
use the archive to catch up.

To use streaming replication,
* set up a file-based log-shipping standby server

* The step that turns a file-based log-shipping standby into streaming
replication standby is setting primary_conninfo setting in the
recovery.conf file to point to the primary server

* On systems that support the keepalive socket option, setting
tcp_keepalives_idle, tcp_keepalives_interval and tcp_keepalives_count
helps the primary promptly notice a broken connection.

* Set the maximum number of concurrent connections from the standby
servers (see max_wal_senders for details).

* When the standby is started and primary_conninfo is set correctly, the
standby will connect to the primary after replaying all WAL files
available in the archive. If the connection is established
successfully, you will see a walreceiver process in the standby, and a
corresponding walsender process in the primary.


Note: recovery.conf, can be on standby only. For primary, this file should be
named as recover.done

Once, I collected the whole knowldege of above. And did the configurations
right,

Some directories to look for, while streaming replication is being done are:
<postgres/data/dir>/pg_xlog/
