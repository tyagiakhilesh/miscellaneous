**************************************

Was trying to send an email from mutt today from my vm box. But didn't receive it. On investigation, found that postfix was not running.
Even after trying to start it, postfix was not coming up.

I was getting this error in `systemctl status postfix` scan_dir_push: open directory defer: Permission denied

To fix it, I simply run `sudo postfix set-permissions` and then `systemctl start postfix`. Now potfix came up.
